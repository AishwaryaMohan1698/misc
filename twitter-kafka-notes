No, there's no way to filter on a user's profile location using Twitter's basic streaming API. The only way you'd be able to do that would be via the commercial Gnip PowerTrack API, with the geolocation enrichment.


 you can use Search API for the hostorical tweets up to a limited time. It allows you to give a date interval. However, you can use Streamin API to catch the recently posted tweets as a tweet stream that contains the keywords that you give.


cannot search with language withpout atleast one track

You can't use autowired properties in the class consturctor since Spring just inject the @Autowired properties after the creation of that class. However you can use the autowired properties in the method with annotation @PostConstruct which will run right after the constructor run.
